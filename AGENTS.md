# DailyLah — guide for AI coding agents (Cursor, Codex, etc.)

> Same content as CLAUDE.md. Keep both files in sync.

Read `docs/PRD.md` first. It is the source of truth for scope, phases and constraints.
Product: free Android app (Flutter) for Singapore residents. Daily morning/evening cards
built from data.gov.sg (NEA, HDB, CEA) and LTA DataMall. Tourist mode is out of scope.

## Repo layout
- `backend/` — Python 3.12, FastAPI. Deployed to Render (free) via `render.yaml`.
- `app/` — Flutter app (Riverpod, dio). Platform folders are generated with `flutter create`.
- `web/` — static site on Vercel: landing page, privacy policy, static data bundles in `web/data/`.
- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements (Bahasa Indonesia).
- `scripts/` — one-off ops scripts (QStash schedule).

## Commands
- Backend: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest && ruff check . && ruff format --check .`
- Run API locally: `cd backend && cp .env.example .env && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Trigger a poll locally: `curl -X POST localhost:8000/internal/poll`
- App: `cd app && flutter pub get && flutter analyze && flutter test`
- Run app against local API (Android emulator): `flutter run --dart-define=API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000`

## Hard rules (free-tier budget — read before adding features)
- Upstash Redis free = 500K commands/month. Serve reads from in-process memory; write to
  Redis only when content changed (`Cache.set` already does this). Never call Redis per request
  in a hot path without memory caching first.
- QStash free = 1,000 messages/day, max 10 schedules. One schedule (`*/2 * * * *`) calls
  `/internal/poll`; per-dataset intervals live in `backend/app/sources.py`. Do not add schedules.
- Bus arrival is fetched on demand per stop with a short memory TTL. Never poll all stops.
- Neon free = 0.5 GB, 100 CU-hours, sleeps after 5 min idle. Use it for static/spatial data only;
  the poller must not write to Neon every cycle.
- Render free sleeps after 15 min without traffic and has an ephemeral filesystem. No local state.
- Vercel Hobby cron runs once per day only. Daily data rebuilds run in GitHub Actions.

## Privacy rules
- User locations and favourites stay on the device. The server only sees stop codes and FCM topics.
- No accounts, no identifying analytics.
- Secrets only via env vars. Never commit `.env`, API keys, or keystores.

## API conventions
- Public endpoints under `/v1/*`, read-only, return `{"fetched_at": <unix>, "data": <upstream>}`.
- `/internal/*` endpoints require a valid `Upstash-Signature` (QStash) outside `ENV=dev`.
- Upstream headers: data.gov.sg uses `x-api-key` (optional, higher limits); LTA uses `AccountKey`.
- Every new endpoint gets a pytest test with `respx` mocks; no real network calls in tests.

## Style
- Python: ruff (line length 100), type hints, async httpx.
- Dart: flutter_lints, Riverpod providers, no business logic in widgets.
- Commit messages in English, imperative mood.
